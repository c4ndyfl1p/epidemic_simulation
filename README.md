# epidemic_simulation

## Please go through this.

I have created a code-base for the project to work on and divided tasks as issues. Open the ISSUES tab and comment on the task you will like to do. I have tried to make it well documented, however if there is any confusion please do ask.

The project is made using p5.js,for ref: https://p5js.org/ and https://thecodingtrain.com/ and any videos by Dan Schiffman.
